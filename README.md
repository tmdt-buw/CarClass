# Applied Feature-Oriented Project Life Cycle Classification: An Approach for the Classification of Multivariate Real-World Automotive Development Projects

## Abstract
The increasing complexity in automotive product development is forcing traditional manufacturers to fundamentally rethink. 
As a result, many companies are already investing in the development of methods to increase the controllability of their development processes. 
The use of data-driven approaches is a promising way to provide an early prediction of potential problems in the course of a project by learning from the past. 
In vehicle development, projects can be divided into two basic categories: new vehicle launches and model enhancement projects. 
The course of projects according to the above-mentioned categories can be based on different influencing factors.
To verify this hypothesis and to determine the extent of the differences in the data, we will carry out a data-driven classification of the project category.
In contrast to the recognition of other time-dependent data (e.g., univariate sensor data courses), we will use multivariate project information from the automotive industry.
With this paper, we will prove that multivariate automotive projects classification can be realised.

## Requirements
You will just need a current working version of Python 3.7 and the inline mentioned libraries.
